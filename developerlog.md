# oracle_fusion_element_proration
As I'll soon be starting a new role as an Oracle Fusion Payroll Consultant, I wanted to practice some of the required skills. In this mini project
I'll be creating a new version of the GLB_EARN_PRORATION Fast Formula and then using the configuration options to associate it with a regular earnings element.
The out-of-the-box proration functionality uses a calendar days pro-ration method, so for this exercise I'll be amending this to use the working days method. 

## Scenario
